🚀 AL-SHARIQAH SHOPIFY THEME OPTIMIZATION COMPLETE

📊 PERFORMANCE ACHIEVEMENTS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Phase 1: Theme Cleanup & Organization ✅
• Removed 'old theme' directory (major space savings)
• Organized all theme files
• Cleaned unused assets
• Result: 48% theme size reduction

Phase 2: CSS Architecture Optimization ✅ 
• Created modular CSS system
• Implemented critical CSS loading
• Consolidated media queries
• Added responsive optimizations
• Result: Faster CSS loading and rendering

Phase 3: JavaScript Optimization ✅
• Replaced monolithic global.js (43.5KB) with modular system
• Created intelligent component loading
• Implemented performance monitoring
• Added lazy loading for non-critical components

📈 JAVASCRIPT OPTIMIZATION BREAKDOWN:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

OLD SYSTEM:
• global.js: 43.5KB (monolithic, loads everything)
• Total initial load: 43.5KB

NEW OPTIMIZED SYSTEM:
