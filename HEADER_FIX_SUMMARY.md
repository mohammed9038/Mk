# Header Position Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
The header layout was broken due to a mismatched HTML structure that didn't align with the CSS Grid system.

## Root Cause
The header.liquid file had been modified to use custom flexbox layout (`header__main-row`, `header__left-section`, etc.) instead of the original CSS Grid system that the theme's CSS was designed for.

## Solution Applied
1. **Restored Original Header Structure**: Replaced the modified header.liquid with the original version from the backup
2. **CSS Grid Alignment**: The original header structure uses proper grid-area assignments:
   - `header__heading` → `grid-area: heading`
   - `header__inline-menu` → `grid-area: navigation`  
   - `header__icons` → `grid-area: icons`
   - Left icons for top-center layout → `grid-area: left-icons`

## Verified Components
✅ **Logo/Store Name**: Properly positioned with grid-area: heading
✅ **Navigation Menu**: Uses grid-area: navigation with proper dropdown/mega-menu support
✅ **Icons Section**: Cart, account, search, and localization icons with grid-area: icons
✅ **Header Drawer**: Mobile navigation drawer functional
✅ **Search Modal**: Search functionality with modal overlay
✅ **Localization**: Language and country selectors properly integrated

## Layout Options Available
- `header--top-left` - Logo top-left, menu and icons arranged horizontally
- `header--top-center` - Logo centered at top, with left-icons grid area
- `header--middle-left` - Logo middle-left position
- `header--middle-center` - Logo centered in middle

## Files Affected
- **sections/header.liquid**: Restored to original CSS Grid structure
- **assets/base.css**: Already contained proper grid layout definitions
- **snippets/**: All header-related snippets (header-drawer, header-mega-menu, etc.) intact

## Result
Header positioning options now work correctly with no conflicting code. The theme editor should show proper positioning controls and all layout options should function as designed.

## Backup Created
- **sections/header-backup.liquid**: Contains the modified version for reference
